Description: This site contains a lorem ipsum generator, dummy user generator, and an xkcd 
password generator. Lorem Ipsum takes in the number of paragraphs and number of sentences 
per paragraph an returns lorem ipsum text of the specified length. The dummy user 
generator allows users to choose which contact fields will be included, the number of 
users, and the option to output plain text on a JSON object. The password generator creates 
5 passwords for the user to choose from. The user also has the option to choose from 4 
inputs to generate a custom password. They can determine the number of words, 
the character that links each word, and add a symbol and/or a number to the end of the 
password. 

Screencast Demo: COMING SOON!

Note: 100% of the HTML and 80% of the CSS was written by me. I did leverage some codepens
for design inspiration. I also kept the DOM Parser from P2. The original code can be found
