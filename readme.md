Description: This site contains a lorem ipsum generator, dummy user generator, and an xkcd 
password generator. "Ipsum" accepts the desired number of paragraphs and sentences 
per paragraph an returns lorem ipsum text of the specified length. "User" allows visitors 
to choose which contact fields will be included, the number of users, and the option to 
output plain text as a JSON object. "Password" creates 5 passwords for the user 
to choose from. The user also has the option to choose from 4 inputs to generate a custom 
password. They can determine the number of words, the character that links each word, and 
add a symbol and/or a number to the end of the password. 

Screencast Demo: COMING SOON!

Note: 100% of the HTML and 80% of the CSS was written by me. I did leverage some codepens
for design inspiration. I also kept the DOM Parser from P2. The original code can be found
